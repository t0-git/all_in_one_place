## Reverse shell blocked on linux ?

- See if `iptables` or `ufw` are enabled, and if you can, show the rules. 
- It's also possible that it blocks only on the name of the application trying to reverse shell, so try copy `/bin/bash` in `/dev/shm/<name_it_like_you_want>` and do it again.

## Problem with output

When something doesn't appear after trying to execute a payload on a website, try use ```2>&1``` at the end

To test it locally, if you enter ```nc -h >/dev/null``` and you doesn't see output, it's because the output is in standard error (stderr). By default it prints standard ouput (stdout).
