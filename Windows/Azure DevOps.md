## Theory

GUI to manage your project like git

## Upload file

- click on the project 
- Then repos > Branches
- New Branch
- Name > whatever
- Based on : master
- click on it, upload files
- upload what you want (reverse shell in aspx ?)
- Create a pull request
- Create
- Approve > Complete > Complete merge
- File is uploaded !


## Execute a powershell command.


- Pipelines > New Pipeline
- AzureRepos
- Your Project
- Starter Pipeline
- Delete everything except steps part.
- In scripts: put the command you want to execute in powershell (whoami for example)
- Save and run
- Create a new branch 
- Put some title
- save and run
- If you are administrator, it's over :)

- Or simply : Processes => Run Command.
