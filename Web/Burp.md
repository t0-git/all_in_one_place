## Find IDORs with Authorize and Auto Reapeater

- Authenticate with 2 different accounts in two browsers

### Authorize

- For each request, it will send an equal request with something changed. We can automate the process to find IDORs or Access Control issues.
- Copy all the cookies of one of the user (the least privileges)
- Paste in Authorize extensions
- Add filter : **Scope Items only** / **Ignore js css png...** / **Ignore spider requests**.
- Click on Autorize is on and that's it.
- Browse the entire website and check some times if you have ```Is enforced??``` and audit the request.
- When you have checked something, go to the ```Proxy```, select in the ```HTTP history``` the checked parts, and mark it out of score, then ```Clear List``` in Authorize.

### Autorepeater

- Used when you have UUIDs to automate the process of check and replace. (org UUID, user UUID ...).
- Can be combinated with authorize.
- Click on ```Add```
- ```Request String```
- Replace the UUID by another one
- ```Replace All```
- ```Active AutoRepeater```
- To have a better view, we will change the color of the 200 modified request :
1. ```Log Highlighter```
2. ```Green```
3. ```Or```
4. ```Modified```
5. ```Status Code```
6. ```Equal to```
7. ```200```

- Add your own (False to True, User to Admin, Content type XML to JSON ...)
