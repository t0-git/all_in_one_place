## Theory

- Here, the idea is to manipulate a functionnality. You know how something works, but you try to manipulate things which shouldn't be manipulated normally.

## Tips

**Think outside the box. How does it work, what can I do which was not intended**
- Payment gateways or points systems are great places to look
- Look for ways to skip over steps
- Look for parameters and try to manipulate it (-1, 0, put some to no existent, or nothing inside ...)
- Fuzz key value, put content in json, change the content type ...
- Financial impact is easy to show, but others impacts exist (reputation ...)
- APIs are full of good information
