## Helpful functions

- `console.log` is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user
Use `eval` just after that to evaluate javascript code represented as string : `console.log(eval('2 + 2'))`

- If you have obfuscated string with () at the end, delete the () and replace it by toString().
